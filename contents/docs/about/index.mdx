# 👋 Hi, I’m Saksham Tandon

I am a versatile and passionate digital designer, scientific illustrator, and software engineer, with a BA in Global Business and Digital Arts from the University of Waterloo and a Diploma in Software Engineering from BrainStation.

I have also completed a certificate in Data Science and am currently pursuing a MicroMasters in Data Science (MITx) on eDX platform, further expanding my expertise.

At CDW Canada, I specialize in creating engaging and responsive web banners, landing pages, and emails that adhere to brand standards and strategies. I conduct thorough user research and testing to enhance user experiences and drive conversion rates. A notable achievement includes contributing to a 193% increase in Research Hub article views and a 93% boost in partner page traffic through strategic content planning and implementation.

Additionally, as a Scientific Illustrator, I collaborate with researchers to produce illustrations and animations featured on covers and supplementary materials in scientific papers and journals. Notably, I designed a journal cover for Biophysical Journal showcasing the experimental setup and structure of pulmonary surfactants.

Having completed my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I gained proficiency in coding and web application development, I am now expanding my expertise in data science. I am currently learning Python for data analysis, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. This knowledge empowers me to integrate statistical analysis and predictive modeling into innovative digital solutions.
