## üìù Our Solution
Lynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity. It is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local, wellness-oriented activities.

The app focuses on fostering safe, low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users‚Äô emotional needs. By encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities, the platform supports users in rebuilding routines, forming new relationships, and staying mentally and physically active.

## üîç Initial Research and Insights

We started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they're socially isolated, especially during big life changes like moving for school or work. As young adults ourselves, we brought our first-hand experiences to the table, which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported, connected, and motivated to get involved in our communities again.

### Target Audience
Based on our initial research, we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health, with the following criteria:

### Competitive Landscape

During our initial research, we also conducted market research to better understand our target audience and their needs. We performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market. This helped us recognize the importance of emotional design and user-centered care in creating a supportive and encouraging platform.

#### Competitors

- **Meetup**: Focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations.

- **Citysocializer and Nextdoor**: Offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events, while Nextdoor is known for fostering a safe, friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence. However, these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness.

- **Eventbrite**: A popular event management platform that allows users to create, advertise, and sell tickets for events. It provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience. Eventbrite's focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness.

- **Wine For The People and Clozette**: Wine For The People offers wine tastings and events in an open, approachable setting, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Clozette, on the other hand, builds niche communities through lifestyle branding. Neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness.

While these platforms help with connections in different ways, they don't fully meet the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of our target audience. This showed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long isolation.
<Note>
  ### Key Takeaways

1. **Gaps in Current Solutions**: Existing platforms do not fully address the emotional and mental health needs of young adults experiencing social isolation. There is a significant opportunity to fill this gap with a platform that focuses on emotional wellness and user-centered care.

2. **Community and Connection**: Building a sense of community and facilitating real-world connections are key to combating social isolation. Users value friendships, community, and shared experiences.

3. **Accessibility and Usability**: The platform needs to be accessible and easy to use, ensuring that users can easily find and participate in local activities without feeling overwhelmed.

4. **Support for Small Businesses**: Lynk also provides a valuable platform for small businesses to promote their events, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem for both users and businesses.

5. **Focus on Mental Wellness**: Addressing mental wellness is a core aspect of Lynk. The platform aims to minimize stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation by providing a seamless way for individuals to engage in social activities.

7. **Local Focus**: By focusing on Ontario, Lynk can leverage local resources and build a strong community within a specific geographic area, making it easier to address the unique needs of the target audience.

## üîÑ The Design Process

Our design process was iterative and user-centered, focusing on creating a platform that effectively addresses the needs of young adults experiencing social isolation. We began with a low-fidelity mockup to establish the foundational concept and layout of the application. Through user testing and feedback, we identified key areas for improvement, such as the need for a more minimalistic design and better emphasis on safety measures.

In the subsequent iterations, we developed high-fidelity prototypes, incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience and establish branding elements. Each iteration built upon the previous one, with a focus on refining the design and functionality of the platform based on user interactions and testing results. Our goal was to create a seamless and intuitive user experience that promotes mental and physical well-being, ultimately addressing the challenges of social isolation.


### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback

- **Goal**: Establish the core concept and gather initial user feedback.
- **Methods**:
  - Conducted initial market research to identify the target audience and their needs.
  - Developed a Business Model Canvas to outline the business strategy and value proposition.
  - Mapped the User Flow and developed Low-Fidelity Prototypes for both web and mobile platforms to visualize the initial design concepts.
  - Conducted Usability Testing and a Survey to gauge the reception of the idea and establish a basic application layout.

Our goal in iteration one was to create a solid foundation for our business idea, focusing on visual design, business, and user experience. We aimed to establish a comprehensive understanding of our target audience and their needs, as well as the overall direction of our project. By completing these methods, we were able to meet our goal of creating a solid foundation for our business idea, revolving around the three pillars of our capstone project.

#### Usability Testing
<Note>
**Testing Method**:
  - Conducted an unregulated test on Figma using simple low-fidelity (LoFi) mockups followed by a small survey.
  - The purpose of this test was to gauge the reception of the idea and lay the base for the layout of the app.
  - Most of our users were between the ages of 18 and 23, which ideally lies in our target demographic, although on the younger side.
</Note>
<Note>
**User Tasks**:
  - Users were tasked with two related activities while navigating through the prototype:
    1. Logging into the app and signing up to attend an activity.
    2. Creating an activity for others to attend.
  - Users had the choice of interacting with either a desktop version or a mobile version, depending on their preferred device.
</Note>
**Findings**:
  - Users were mostly able to complete the tasks and navigate the mockup with relative ease.
  - Identified friction in completing tasks due to UX-related reasons, such as a lack of indicators for confirmation when joining an event.
  - Some users indicated that there was too much information being presented, making the whole experience overwhelming and distracting.

**User Feedback**:
  - One user mentioned, "I'm not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype, but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me. It took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else."
  - The idea received mixed receptions, with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during COVID-19. Another user commented, "I guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically. I guess I was expecting more attention to the whole COVID limitation part. To me, it just felt like a way to create events as normal."

**Design Improvements**:
  - Identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way.
  - Recognized the need to optimize button size and design, as some users found the buttons too small.
  - Considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly, including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design.

Through the usability testing we carried out, we were able to identify certain aspects of our visual design which we should improve upon. One of the pieces of feedback from our usability testing was that there was an overwhelming amount of information being provided. We learned that we have to provide our information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way than what we had designed. Another aspect of our visual design which could be improved upon are the buttons. We would need to make our buttons the optimal size and design, as we realized that our buttons may have been considered too small by some of our users. We also learned from this iteration that we might change the visual layout of the application in order to appear more modern and friendly. We can make the application appear more modern and friendly by modifying aspects of visual elements such as the spacing between headings on the menu and by changing the design of the menu altogether.
