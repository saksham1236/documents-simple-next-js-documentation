I conduct thorough user research and testing to enhance user experiences and drive conversion rates. A notable achievement includes contributing to a 193% increase in Research Hub article views and a 93% boost in partner page traffic through strategic content planning and implementation.\n\nAdditionally, as a Scientific Illustrator, I collaborate with researchers to produce illustrations and animations featured on covers and supplementary materials in scientific papers and journals. Notably, I designed a journal cover for Biophysical Journal showcasing the experimental setup and structure of pulmonary surfactants.\n\nHaving completed my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I gained proficiency in coding and web application development, I am now expanding my expertise in data science. I am currently learning Python for data analysis, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. This knowledge empowers me to integrate statistical analysis and predictive modeling into innovative digital solutions.\n\n***\n\n## 🎨 What I Do\n\n* **UX & UI Design** – Intuitive and accessible digital products.\n* **Motion Design** – Animation that clarifies and captivates.\n* **Scientific Illustration** – Visual storytelling for research and science.\n* **Front-End Development** – Building fast, responsive web experiences with modern tools.\n\n***\n\n## 💼 Experience\n\n### Associate Designer\n\n**CDW Canada** · Full-time\r\n📅 Jan 2022 - Present\n\nDesigns static and animated digital/web banners for desktop and mobile.\\\nDevelops and maintains CDW.ca landing pages and emails aligned with brand standards.\\\nTranslates strategic goals into cohesive, responsive digital designs using industry tools.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* Achieved a **193% YoY increase** in Research Hub article views\n* Boosted partner page traffic by **93%** through strategic content planning\n\n### Scientific Illustrator\n\n**Freelance**\r\n📅 Sep 2020 - Present\n\n* Designed the cover for the prestigious Biophysical journal.\n* Produced drawings and illustrations to enhance scientific papers and presentations.\n* Conducted comprehensive research on scientific papers, gaining a deep understanding of theories and core concepts behind experiments and results.\n\n***\n\n## 🧠 My Philosophy\n\n> “Design is empathy in action.

    "content": "## ✨ Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.\n\nAs the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.\n\n## 🔍 Research and Analysis\n\nThe logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.\n\n### Logo Mark Ideas\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas-2.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n### Direction #1 - Playful Gradients, minimalist while being engaging.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-1.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-1.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #2 - Pure minimalist, simple with flat colors.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-2.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-2.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #3 - Mix of both styles.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-3.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n## 🎨 Final Style Guide\n\nThe team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the \"B\" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/final-style-guide.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n## 💻 Website Design Mockup\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/website-mock.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Desktop Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-desktop.png\" altText=\"Desktop Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mobile Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-mobile.png\" altText=\"Mobile Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n## 📱 Some Social Media Assets\n\n### Instagram Post Carousel\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/insta-carousel.png\" altText=\"Instagram Carousel\" />\n\n### Addition of Patterns\n\nTo honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity.

    "content": "## 💡 The Idea\n\nLynk began as a capstone project focused on addressing the growing issue of **social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health**, particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments. We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.\n\n## 📝 Our Goal:\n\n**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.\n\n## 🎯 Our Focusing Themes:\n\n<Tag>🤝 Connection</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧠 Mental Wellness</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📍 Local Activities</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🌱 Community Building</Tag>\n\n## ❓ The Core Problem\n\n## 🧠 Our Roles\n\n<Tag>🔍 UX Research</Tag>\r\n<Tag>✨ Visual Design</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧪 Usability Testing</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📱 Prototyping</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📊 Business Analysis</Tag>\n\n## 📱 About Lynk\n\nLynk is a **website and mobile application** designed to help users easily discover and join local activities, fostering social interaction and community engagement. It also provides small businesses with a platform to promote their events.\n\n## 🔍 User Research & Insights\n\nOur research highlighted that young adults (aged 20-28, especially those in new environments) often experience **sadness, anxiety, and restlessness due to isolation**. They value friendships, community, and physical activity with others.\n\nKey challenges identified:\n\n* Difficulty finding opportunities to connect with others.\n* Lack of motivation for independent activities.\n* Emotional distress from prolonged solitude.\n\n**(Image Suggestion: A diagram or infographic summarizing key user needs and challenges.)**\n\n## 🔄 Our Iterative Process\n\nWe followed a 3-iteration process, driven by user feedback and analysis.\n\n### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback\n\n* **Goal:** Establish the core concept and gather initial user feedback.\n* **Methods:** Initial market research, Business Model Canvas, Low-Fidelity Prototypes (web/mobile), Usability Testing & Survey.\n* **Learnings:** Users found initial prototypes overwhelming, lacked confirmation indicators, and highlighted the need to emphasize safety. Initial revenue model showed a long break-even period.\n\n#### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 1 (Activity Creation & Promotion Setup)\n\nKey Usability Issues Identified:\n\n* Misleading page descriptions and varied headings.\n* Lack of user input feedback on filled fields.\n* System buttons needed more emphasis.\n* Users were lost on their step in the activity creation process.\n* Unclear terminology (\"add requirements,\" \"Promotion Reach\").\n* Tedious overall activity creation experience.\n* Missing event fees on the activity confirmation page.\n\nRecommendations Included:\n\n* Provide more varied page descriptions and consistent heading structures.\n* Create versions of pages with content filled in for better feedback.\n* Emphasize system buttons.\n* Implement visual indicators for the stage of activity creation.\n* Relabel unclear terms (e.g., \"add requirements\" to \"pre-requisites\").\n* Reduce the number of pages or offer a quick creation option.\n* Add event fees to the activity confirmation page.\n\n**(Image Suggestion: Screenshots of the Low-Fidelity Prototypes from Iteration 1.)**\r\n**(Chart Suggestion: Initial Business Model Canvas or Financial Projection overview.)**\n\n### Iteration 2: Refining UI & Exploring Viability\n\n* **Goal:** Develop high-fidelity prototypes, establish branding, and explore alternative revenue streams.\n* **Methods:** User Persona, Impact Map, High-Fidelity Desktop Prototype, Branding (Name, Logo, Style Guide), SWOT/5 P's Analysis, Updated Financials, Usability Testing.\n* **Learnings:** Positive feedback on visual design but users struggled with navigation (finding create/join activity). Identified small business promotions as a viable revenue stream. Learned the importance of clear wording.\n\n#### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 2 (Community, Business & Analytics Pages)\n\nKey Usability Issues Identified:\n\n* No progress indication after editing activities on the analytics page.\n* No implementation of an undo button for edits.\n* Difficulty differentiating \"Save Changes\" and \"Edit Promotion\" buttons due to similar appearance.\n* No recommended communities for users to join.\n* Limited variety of settings for user flexibility.\n* Absence of an error screen.\n* No help pages or documentation available.\n\nRecommendations Included:\n\n* Add a progress indicator (circle or bar) after saving changes on the analytics page.\n* Implement a small undo button.\n* Change the appearance of one of the buttons (\"Save Changes\" or \"Edit Promotion\") for better differentiation.\n* Provide recommended communities based on user interests.\n* Offer more diverse settings options (e.g., Dark Mode).\n* Include a designed error screen.\n* Implement help pages and a \"Need Help?\" or \"FAQs\" link at the bottom of pages.\n\n**(Image Suggestion: Screenshots of the High-Fidelity Desktop Prototype from Iteration 2 and the Lynk logo/style guide elements.)**\r\n**(Chart Suggestion: Impact Map or updated Financial Statement summaries.)**\n\n### Iteration 3: Enhancing Flows & Data-Driven Decisions\n\n* **Goal:** Refine core user flows (especially activity creation), integrate business features, and use in-depth research for prioritization.\n* **Methods:** One-on-One Usability Testing (focus on activity creation), Kano Model Survey, Refined Financials & Break-Even Analysis, PEST Analysis.\n* **Learnings:** Activity creation was still seen as tedious. Users had issues with content organization and understanding context. Kano model prioritized features like ratings and feedback.\n\n**(Image Suggestion: Screenshots of the refined \"Create an Activity\" flow and other key screens from Iteration 3.)**\r\n**(Chart Suggestion: Kano Model results chart and the final financial projections/break-even chart.)**\n\n## ✨ The Solution\n\nThe final Lynk prototype is a user-centered platform designed for intuitive activity discovery, creation, and community engagement, incorporating learnings from all iterations.\n\nKey features include:\n\n* Easy Browse and searching for nearby activities.\n* Streamlined (though iteratively improved) activity creation process.\n* Dedicated profiles for communities and businesses.\n* Integrated promotional features for businesses.\n* A clear visual design and improved navigation.\n* Planned features for ratings, feedback, onboarding, and help, directly addressing heuristic findings and Kano model priorities.\n\n**(Image Suggestion: High-quality screenshots of the final Lynk prototype for both web and mobile.)**\r\n**(Video/GIF Suggestion: A short video or GIF demonstrating key user interactions.)**\n\n## 📊 The Results\n\nOur iterative process yielded significant insights and promising quantitative outcomes:\n\n* **User Growth:** Projected growth from **6,000 users (Year 1) to 24,000 users (Year 3)**.\n* **Revenue:** Diversified model including:\n  * In-app Transactions: **$30,240 (Year 1)**\n  * Paid Business Promotions: **$4,320 (Year 1)**\n  * Targeted Advertising: **$375 (Year 1)**\n  * Total Income (Year 1): **$34,935**\n* **Profitability:** Projected to reach **break-even in ~2 years and 9 months**, with a positive net income in Year 3.\n* **Feature Prioritization (Kano Model):** Validated the importance of mandatory features like Ratings System, Participating in Promoted Events, and Sharing Feedback.\n\nThese results indicate both a strong potential to meet user needs and a viable path to business sustainability.\n\n**(Chart Suggestion: Graphs showing user growth, revenue breakdown, and financial projections/break-even.)**\r\n**(Table Suggestion: Final financial projections summary table.)**\n\n## ✅ Conclusion & Next Steps\n\nLynk successfully addresses the challenge of social isolation through an empathetic and iterative design process. By continuously incorporating user feedback, usability testing, and heuristic evaluations, we developed a platform with a clear value proposition and a viable business model. The learnings from each iteration directly informed design refinements and feature prioritization, leading to a more user-centered product concept.\n\nFuture steps include:\n\n* Further refining the activity creation flow based on ongoing feedback.\n* Implementing comprehensive onboarding and help features identified as crucial for usability (addressing heuristic findings).\n* Finalizing the mobile prototype development.\n* Expanding partnerships with small businesses.\n* Continuously iterating based on user feedback and market trends to ensure Lynk remains a valuable tool for fostering connection and combating isolation.\n\nLynk is poised to become a valuable tool for fostering connection and enhancing well-being in communities.\n\n***\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder image and chart suggestions with your actual visuals and adjust the `author` tag as needed.
