## üí° The Idea

Lynk began as a capstone project focused on addressing the growing issue of **social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health**, particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments. We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.

## üìù Our Goal:

**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.

## üì± About Lynk

Lynk is a **website and mobile application** designed to help users easily discover and join local activities, fostering social interaction and community engagement. It also provides small businesses with a platform to promote their events.

## üîç Initial Research and Insights

We started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they're socially isolated, especially during big life changes like moving for school or work. As young adults ourselves, we brought our first-hand experiences to the table, which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported, connected, and motivated to get involved in our communities again.
### Target Audience

Based on our initial research, we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health, with the following criteria:

<CardGrid className ="mb-10">
  <Note>
    #### Age Range
    20-28 years. We are specifically focusing on youth on the verge of entering adulthood and its social challenges.
  </Note>

  <Note>
    #### Location
    Ontario. Geographically, we plan to restrict our application‚Äôs reach within the province of Ontario to establish a more narrow target audience, using pre-existing online Canadian resources.
  </Note>

  <Note>
    #### Relocating to New Environments
    Both graduates and non-graduates who are moving into new environments that are relatively unknown to them.
  </Note>
</CardGrid>
### Target Audience Mood Board
We asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board. It reflects their experiences and captures the essence of their emotional landscape, highlighting their struggles and aspirations.

  </Note>

  <Note type="warning">
    ### Challenges
    Our target audience often faces the following challenges:
    - Feelings of sadness, distress, confusion, or anger when experiencing complete isolation at home.
    - Restlessness, leading to increased irritability and upset over seemingly minor things.
    - Fear and worry about mental health status when situated in unknown regions for extended periods.
    - Possible worsening of pre-existing health problems, such as chronic conditions, due to lack of outdoor activity and necessary exercise.

### Competitive Landscape

During our initial research, we also conducted market research to better understand our target audience and their needs. We performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market. This helped us recognize the importance of emotional design and user-centered care in creating a supportive and encouraging platform.

#### Competitors

- **Meetup**: Focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations.

- **Citysocializer and Nextdoor**: Offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events, while Nextdoor is known for fostering a safe, friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence. However, these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness.

- **Eventbrite**: A popular event management platform that allows users to create, advertise, and sell tickets for events. It provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience. Eventbrite's focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness.

- **Wine For The People and Clozette**: Wine For The People offers wine tastings and events in an open, approachable setting, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Clozette, on the other hand, builds niche communities through lifestyle branding. Neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness.

While these platforms help with connections in different ways, they don't fully meet the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of our target audience. This showed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long isolation.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Gaps in Current Solutions**: Existing platforms do not fully address the emotional and mental health needs of young adults experiencing social isolation. There is a significant opportunity to fill this gap with a platform that focuses on emotional wellness and user-centered care.

3. **Community and Connection**: Building a sense of community and facilitating real-world connections are key to combating social isolation. Users value friendships, community, and shared experiences.

4. **Accessibility and Usability**: The platform needs to be accessible and easy to use, ensuring that users can easily find and participate in local activities without feeling overwhelmed.

5. **Support for Small Businesses**: Lynk also provides a valuable platform for small businesses to promote their events, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem for both users and businesses.

6. **Focus on Mental Wellness**: Addressing mental wellness is a core aspect of Lynk. The platform aims to minimize stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation by providing a seamless way for individuals to engage in social activities.

7. **Local Focus**: By focusing on Ontario, Lynk can leverage local resources and build a strong community within a specific geographic area, making it easier to address the unique needs of the target audience.


## üîÑ Our Iterative Process

We followed a 3-iteration process, driven by user feedback and analysis.

### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback

- **Goal:** Establish the core concept and gather initial user feedback.
- **Methods:** Initial market research, Business Model Canvas, Low-Fidelity Prototypes (web/mobile), Usability Testing & Survey.
- **Learnings:** Users found initial prototypes overwhelming, lacked confirmation indicators, and highlighted the need to emphasize safety. Initial revenue model showed a long break-even period.

#### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 1 (Activity Creation & Promotion Setup)

Key Usability Issues Identified:
- Misleading page descriptions and varied headings.
- Lack of user input feedback on filled fields.
- System buttons needed more emphasis.
- Users were lost on their step in the activity creation process.
- Unclear terminology ("add requirements," "Promotion Reach").
- Tedious overall activity creation experience.
- Missing event fees on the activity confirmation page.

Recommendations Included:
- Provide more varied page descriptions and consistent heading structures.
- Create versions of pages with content filled in for better feedback.
- Emphasize system buttons.
- Implement visual indicators for the stage of activity creation.
- Relabel unclear terms (e.g., "add requirements" to "pre-requisites").
- Reduce the number of pages or offer a quick creation option.
- Add event fees to the activity confirmation page.

### Iteration 2: Refining UI & Exploring Viability

- **Goal:** Develop high-fidelity prototypes, establish branding, and explore alternative revenue streams.
- **Methods:** User Persona, Impact Map, High-Fidelity Desktop Prototype, Branding (Name, Logo, Style Guide), SWOT/5 P's Analysis, Updated Financials, Usability Testing.
- **Learnings:** Positive feedback on visual design but users struggled with navigation (finding create/join activity). Identified small business promotions as a viable revenue stream. Learned the importance of clear wording.

#### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 2 (Community, Business & Analytics Pages)

Key Usability Issues Identified:
- No progress indication after editing activities on the analytics page.
- No implementation of an undo button for edits.
- Difficulty differentiating "Save Changes" and "Edit Promotion" buttons due to similar appearance.
- No recommended communities for users to join.
- Limited variety of settings for user flexibility.
- Absence of an error screen.
- No help pages or documentation available.

Recommendations Included:
- Add a progress indicator (circle or bar) after saving changes on the analytics page.
- Implement a small undo button.
- Change the appearance of one of the buttons ("Save Changes" or "Edit Promotion") for better differentiation.
- Provide recommended communities based on user interests.
- Offer more diverse settings options (e.g., Dark Mode).
- Include a designed error screen.
- Implement help pages and a "Need Help?" or "FAQs" link at the bottom of pages.
