Bounce Back Coin lets users earn cryptocurrency through learning. I designed the logo, branding guidelines, and website.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.

As the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.

## Research and Analysis

The logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.

## Final Style Guide

The team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the "B" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.

### Addition of Patterns

To honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity. I carefully melded these cultural elements with geometric shapes, ensuring a harmonious blend that enhances the existing design aesthetic.
