I conduct thorough user research and testing to enhance user experiences and drive conversion rates. A notable achievement includes contributing to a 193% increase in Research Hub article views and a 93% boost in partner page traffic through strategic content planning and implementation.\n\nAdditionally, as a Scientific Illustrator, I collaborate with researchers to produce illustrations and animations featured on covers and supplementary materials in scientific papers and journals. Notably, I designed a journal cover for Biophysical Journal showcasing the experimental setup and structure of pulmonary surfactants.\n\nHaving completed my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I gained proficiency in coding and web application development, I am now expanding my expertise in data science. I am currently learning Python for data analysis, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. This knowledge empowers me to integrate statistical analysis and predictive modeling into innovative digital solutions.\n\n***\n\n## 🎨 What I Do\n\n* **UX & UI Design** – Intuitive and accessible digital products.\n* **Motion Design** – Animation that clarifies and captivates.\n* **Scientific Illustration** – Visual storytelling for research and science.\n* **Front-End Development** – Building fast, responsive web experiences with modern tools.\n\n***\n\n## 💼 Experience\n\n### Associate Designer\n\n**CDW Canada** · Full-time\r\n📅 Jan 2022 - Present\n\nDesigns static and animated digital/web banners for desktop and mobile.\\\nDevelops and maintains CDW.ca landing pages and emails aligned with brand standards.\\\nTranslates strategic goals into cohesive, responsive digital designs using industry tools.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* Achieved a **193% YoY increase** in Research Hub article views\n* Boosted partner page traffic by **93%** through strategic content planning\n\n### Scientific Illustrator\n\n**Freelance**\r\n📅 Sep 2020 - Present\n\n* Designed the cover for the prestigious Biophysical journal.\n* Produced drawings and illustrations to enhance scientific papers and presentations.\n* Conducted comprehensive research on scientific papers, gaining a deep understanding of theories and core concepts behind experiments and results.\n\n***\n\n## 🧠 My Philosophy\n\n> “Design is empathy in action.

    "content": "## ✨ Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.\n\nAs the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.\n\n## 🔍 Research and Analysis\n\nThe logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.\n\n### Logo Mark Ideas\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas-2.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n### Direction #1 - Playful Gradients, minimalist while being engaging.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-1.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-1.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #2 - Pure minimalist, simple with flat colors.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-2.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-2.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #3 - Mix of both styles.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-3.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n## 🎨 Final Style Guide\n\nThe team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the \"B\" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/final-style-guide.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n## 💻 Website Design Mockup\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/website-mock.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Desktop Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-desktop.png\" altText=\"Desktop Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mobile Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-mobile.png\" altText=\"Mobile Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n## 📱 Some Social Media Assets\n\n### Instagram Post Carousel\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/insta-carousel.png\" altText=\"Instagram Carousel\" />\n\n### Addition of Patterns\n\nTo honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity.

    "content": "## 💡 The Idea\n\nLynk began as a project focused on addressing the growing issue of **social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health**, particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments. We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.\n\n## 📝 Our Goal\n\n**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.\n\n## 🎯 Our Focusing Themes\n\n<Tag>🤝 Connection</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧠 Mental Wellness</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📍 Local Activities</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🌱 Community Building</Tag>\n\n## ❓ The Core Problem\n\n## 🧠 My Roles\n\n<Tag>🔍 UX Research</Tag>\r\n<Tag>✨ Visual Design</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧪 Usability Testing</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📱 Prototyping</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📊 Business Analysis</Tag>\n\n## 📝 Our Solution\n\nLynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity. It is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local, wellness-oriented activities.\n\nThe app focuses on fostering safe, low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users’ emotional needs. By encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities, the platform supports users in rebuilding routines, forming new relationships, and staying mentally and physically active.\n\n## 🔍 Initial Research and Insights\n\nWe started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they're socially isolated, especially during big life changes like moving for school or work. As young adults ourselves, we brought our first-hand experiences to the table, which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported, connected, and motivated to get involved in our communities again.\n\n### Target Audience\n\nBased on our initial research, we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health, with the following criteria:\n\n### Target Audience Mood Board\n\nWe asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board. It reflects their experiences and captures the essence of their emotional landscape, highlighting their struggles and aspirations.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-1.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-2.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-3.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n### Summarized Insights\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\nDuring our initial research, we also conducted market research to better understand our target audience and their needs. We performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market. This helped us recognize the importance of emotional design and user-centered care in creating a supportive and encouraging platform.\n\n#### Competitors\n\n* **Meetup**: Focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations.\n\n* **Citysocializer and Nextdoor**: Offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events, while Nextdoor is known for fostering a safe, friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence. However, these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness.\n\n* **Eventbrite**: A popular event management platform that allows users to create, advertise, and sell tickets for events. It provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience. Eventbrite's focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness.\n\n* **Wine For The People and Clozette**: Wine For The People offers wine tastings and events in an open, approachable setting, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Clozette, on the other hand, builds niche communities through lifestyle branding. Neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness.\n\nWhile these platforms help with connections in different ways, they don't fully meet the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of our target audience. This showed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long isolation.\n\n## 🔄 The Design Process\n\nOur design process was iterative and user-centered, focusing on creating a platform that effectively addresses the needs of young adults experiencing social isolation. We began with a low-fidelity mockup to establish the foundational concept and layout of the application. Through user testing and feedback, we identified key areas for improvement, such as the need for a more minimalistic design and better emphasis on safety measures.\n\nIn the subsequent iterations, we developed high-fidelity prototypes, incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience and establish branding elements. Each iteration built upon the previous one, with a focus on refining the design and functionality of the platform based on user interactions and testing results. Our goal was to create a seamless and intuitive user experience that promotes mental and physical well-being, ultimately addressing the challenges of social isolation.\n\n### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback\n\n* **Goal**: Establish the core concept and gather initial user feedback.\n* **Methods**:\n  * Conducted initial market research to identify the target audience and their needs.\n  * Developed a Business Model Canvas to outline the business strategy and value proposition.\n  * Mapped the User Flow and developed Low-Fidelity Prototypes for both web and mobile platforms to visualize the initial design concepts.\n  * Conducted Usability Testing and a Survey to gauge the reception of the idea and establish a basic application layout.\n\nOur goal in iteration one was to create a solid foundation for our business idea, focusing on visual design, business, and user experience. We aimed to establish a comprehensive understanding of our target audience and their needs, as well as the overall direction of our project. By completing these methods, we were able to meet our goal of creating a solid foundation for our business idea, revolving around the three pillars of our capstone project.\n\n#### User Flow\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-1-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow\" />\n\n#### Low Fidelity Prototype\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/wireframe-iteration-1.png\" alt=\"Prototype for Iteration 1\" />\n\n#### Usability Testing\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Users were tasked with two related activities while navigating through the prototype:\n    1. Logging into the app and signing up to attend an activity.\n    2. Creating an activity for others to attend.\n  * Users had the choice of interacting with either a desktop version or a mobile version, depending on their preferred device.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were mostly able to complete the tasks and navigate the mockup with relative ease.\n* Identified friction in completing tasks due to UX-related reasons, such as a lack of indicators for confirmation when joining an event.\n* Some users indicated that there was too much information being presented, making the whole experience overwhelming and distracting.\n\n**User Feedback**:\n\n* One user mentioned, \"I'm not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype, but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me. It took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else.\"\n* The idea received mixed receptions, with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during COVID-19. Another user commented, \"I guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically. I guess I was expecting more attention to the whole COVID limitation part. To me, it just felt like a way to create events as normal.\"\n\n**Design Improvements**:\n\n* Identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way.\n* Recognized the need to optimize button size and design, as some users found the buttons too small.\n* Considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly, including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design.\n\nThrough the usability testing we carried out, we were able to identify certain aspects of our visual design which we should improve upon. One of the pieces of feedback from our usability testing was that there was an overwhelming amount of information being provided. We learned that we have to provide our information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way than what we had designed. Another aspect of our visual design which could be improved upon are the buttons. We would need to make our buttons the optimal size and design, as we realized that our buttons may have been considered too small by some of our users. We also learned from this iteration that we might change the visual layout of the application in order to appear more modern and friendly. We can make the application appear more modern and friendly by modifying aspects of visual elements such as the spacing between headings on the menu and by changing the design of the menu altogether.\n\n{/* #### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 1 (Activity Creation & Promotion Setup)\r\n\r\n  Key Usability Issues Identified:\r\n  - Misleading page descriptions and varied headings.\r\n  - Lack of user input feedback on filled fields.\r\n  - System buttons needed more emphasis.\r\n  - Users were lost on their step in the activity creation process.\r\n  - Unclear terminology (\"add requirements,\" \"Promotion Reach\").\r\n  - Tedious overall activity creation experience.\r\n  - Missing event fees on the activity confirmation page.\r\n\r\n  Recommendations Included:\r\n  - Provide more varied page descriptions and consistent heading structures.\r\n  - Create versions of pages with content filled in for better feedback.\r\n  - Emphasize system buttons.\r\n  - Implement visual indicators for the stage of activity creation.\r\n  - Relabel unclear terms (e.g., \"add requirements\" to \"pre-requisites\").\r\n  - Reduce the number of pages or offer a quick creation option.\r\n  - Add event fees to the activity confirmation page.\r\n\r\n  **(Image Suggestion: Screenshots of the Low-Fidelity Prototypes from Iteration 1.)**\r\n  **(Chart Suggestion: Initial Business Model Canvas or Financial Projection overview.)**\r\n\r\n  ### Iteration 2: Refining UI & Exploring Viability\r\n\r\n  - **Goal:** Develop high-fidelity prototypes, establish branding, and explore alternative revenue streams.\r\n  - **Methods:** User Persona, Impact Map, High-Fidelity Desktop Prototype, Branding (Name, Logo, Style Guide), SWOT/5 P's Analysis, Updated Financials, Usability Testing.\r\n  - **Learnings:** Positive feedback on visual design but users struggled with navigation (finding create/join activity). Identified small business promotions as a viable revenue stream. Learned the importance of clear wording.\r\n\r\n  #### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 2 (Community, Business & Analytics Pages)\r\n\r\n  Key Usability Issues Identified:\r\n  - No progress indication after editing activities on the analytics page.\r\n  - No implementation of an undo button for edits.\r\n  - Difficulty differentiating \"Save Changes\" and \"Edit Promotion\" buttons due to similar appearance.\r\n  - No recommended communities for users to join.\r\n  - Limited variety of settings for user flexibility.\r\n  - Absence of an error screen.\r\n  - No help pages or documentation available.\r\n\r\n  Recommendations Included:\r\n  - Add a progress indicator (circle or bar) after saving changes on the analytics page.\r\n  - Implement a small undo button.\r\n  - Change the appearance of one of the buttons (\"Save Changes\" or \"Edit Promotion\") for better differentiation.\r\n  - Provide recommended communities based on user interests.\r\n  - Offer more diverse settings options (e.g., Dark Mode).\r\n  - Include a designed error screen.\r\n  - Implement help pages and a \"Need Help?\" or \"FAQs\" link at the bottom of pages.\r\n\r\n  **(Image Suggestion: Screenshots of the High-Fidelity Desktop Prototype from Iteration 2 and the Lynk logo/style guide elements.)**\r\n  **(Chart Suggestion: Impact Map or updated Financial Statement summaries.)**\r\n\r\n  ### Iteration 3: Enhancing Flows & Data-Driven Decisions\r\n\r\n  - **Goal:** Refine core user flows (especially activity creation), integrate business features, and use in-depth research for prioritization.\r\n  - **Methods:** One-on-One Usability Testing (focus on activity creation), Kano Model Survey, Refined Financials & Break-Even Analysis, PEST Analysis.\r\n  - **Learnings:** Activity creation was still seen as tedious. Users had issues with content organization and understanding context. Kano model prioritized features like ratings and feedback.\r\n\r\n  **(Image Suggestion: Screenshots of the refined \"Create an Activity\" flow and other key screens from Iteration 3.)**\r\n  **(Chart Suggestion: Kano Model results chart and the final financial projections/break-even chart.)**\r\n\r\n  ## ✨ The Solution\r\n\r\n  The final Lynk prototype is a user-centered platform designed for intuitive activity discovery, creation, and community engagement, incorporating learnings from all iterations.\r\n\r\n  Key features include:\r\n  - Easy Browse and searching for nearby activities.\r\n  - Streamlined (though iteratively improved) activity creation process.\r\n  - Dedicated profiles for communities and businesses.\r\n  - Integrated promotional features for businesses.\r\n  - A clear visual design and improved navigation.\r\n  - Planned features for ratings, feedback, onboarding, and help, directly addressing heuristic findings and Kano model priorities.\r\n\r\n  **(Image Suggestion: High-quality screenshots of the final Lynk prototype for both web and mobile.)**\r\n  **(Video/GIF Suggestion: A short video or GIF demonstrating key user interactions.)**\r\n\r\n  ## 📊 The Results\r\n\r\n  Our iterative process yielded significant insights and promising quantitative outcomes:\r\n\r\n  - **User Growth:** Projected growth from **6,000 users (Year 1) to 24,000 users (Year 3)**.\r\n  - **Revenue:** Diversified model including:\r\n    - In-app Transactions: **$30,240 (Year 1)**\r\n    - Paid Business Promotions: **$4,320 (Year 1)**\r\n    - Targeted Advertising: **$375 (Year 1)**\r\n    - Total Income (Year 1): **$34,935**\r\n  - **Profitability:** Projected to reach **break-even in ~2 years and 9 months**, with a positive net income in Year 3.\r\n  - **Feature Prioritization (Kano Model):** Validated the importance of mandatory features like Ratings System, Participating in Promoted Events, and Sharing Feedback.\r\n\r\n  These results indicate both a strong potential to meet user needs and a viable path to business sustainability.\r\n\r\n  **(Chart Suggestion: Graphs showing user growth, revenue breakdown, and financial projections/break-even.)**\r\n  **(Table Suggestion: Final financial projections summary table.)**\r\n\r\n  ## ✅ Conclusion & Next Steps\r\n\r\n  Lynk successfully addresses the challenge of social isolation through an empathetic and iterative design process.

overwhelming and distracting user feedback: one user mentioned i m not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me it took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else the idea received mixed receptions with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during covid-19 another user commented i guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically i guess i was expecting more attention to the whole covid limitation part to me it just felt like a way to create events as normal design improvements: identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way recognized the need to optimize button size and design as some users found the buttons too small considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design through the usability testing we carried out we were able to identify certain aspects of our visual design which we should improve upon one of the pieces of feedback from our usability testing was that there was an overwhelming amount of information being provided we learned that we have to provide our information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way than what we had designed another aspect of our visual design which could be improved upon are the buttons we would need to make our buttons the optimal size and design as we realized that our buttons may have been considered too small by some of our users we also learned from this iteration that we might change the visual layout of the application in order to appear more modern and friendly we can make the application appear more modern and friendly by modifying aspects of visual elements such as the spacing between headings on the menu and by changing the design of the menu altogether heuristic evaluation - iteration 1 activity creation promotion setup key usability issues identified: misleading page descriptions and varied headings lack of user input feedback on filled fields system buttons needed more emphasis users were lost on their step in the activity creation process unclear terminology add requirements promotion reach tedious overall activity creation experience missing event fees on the activity confirmation page recommendations included: provide more varied page descriptions and consistent heading structures create versions of pages with content filled in for better feedback emphasize system buttons implement visual indicators for the stage of activity creation relabel unclear terms e g add requirements to pre-requisites reduce the number of pages or offer a quick creation option add event fees to the activity confirmation page image suggestion: screenshots of the low-fidelity prototypes from iteration 1 chart suggestion: initial business model canvas or financial projection overview iteration 2: refining ui exploring viability goal: develop high-fidelity prototypes establish branding and explore alternative revenue streams methods: user persona impact map high-fidelity desktop prototype branding name logo style guide swot 5 p s analysis updated financials usability testing learnings: positive feedback on visual design but users struggled with navigation finding create join activity identified small business promotions as a viable revenue stream learned the importance of clear wording heuristic evaluation - iteration 2 community business analytics pages key usability issues identified: no progress indication after editing activities on the analytics page no implementation of an undo button for edits difficulty differentiating save changes and edit promotion buttons due to similar appearance no recommended communities for users to join limited variety of settings for user flexibility absence of an error screen no help pages or documentation available recommendations included: add a progress indicator circle or bar after saving changes on the analytics page implement a small undo button change the appearance of one of the buttons save changes or edit promotion for better differentiation provide recommended communities based on user interests offer more diverse settings options e g dark mode include a designed error screen implement help pages and a need help or faqs link at the bottom of pages image suggestion: screenshots of the high-fidelity desktop prototype from iteration 2 and the lynk logo style guide elements chart suggestion: impact map or updated financial statement summaries iteration 3: enhancing flows data-driven decisions goal: refine core user flows especially activity creation integrate business features and use in-depth research for prioritization methods: one-on-one usability testing focus on activity creation kano model survey refined financials break-even analysis pest analysis learnings: activity creation was still seen as tedious users had issues with content organization and understanding context kano model prioritized features like ratings and feedback image suggestion: screenshots of the refined create an activity flow and other key screens from iteration 3 chart suggestion: kano model results chart and the final financial projections break-even chart the solution the final lynk prototype is a user-centered platform designed for intuitive activity discovery creation and community engagement incorporating learnings from all iterations key features include: easy browse and searching for nearby activities streamlined though iteratively improved activity creation process dedicated profiles for communities and businesses integrated promotional features for businesses a clear visual design and improved navigation planned features for ratings feedback onboarding and help directly addressing heuristic findings and kano model priorities image suggestion: high-quality screenshots of the final lynk prototype for both web and mobile video gif suggestion: a short video or gif demonstrating key user interactions the results our iterative process yielded significant insights and promising quantitative outcomes: user growth: projected growth from 6 000 users year 1 to 24 000 users year 3 revenue: diversified model including: in-app transactions: 30 240 year 1 paid business promotions: 4 320 year 1 targeted advertising: 375 year 1 total income year 1 : 34 935 profitability: projected to reach break-even in 2 years and 9 months with a positive net income in year 3 feature prioritization kano model : validated the importance of mandatory features like ratings system participating in promoted events and sharing feedback these results indicate both a strong potential to meet user needs and a viable path to business sustainability chart suggestion: graphs showing user growth revenue breakdown and financial projections break-even table suggestion: final financial projections summary table conclusion next steps lynk successfully addresses the challenge of social isolation through an empathetic and iterative design process by continuously incorporating user feedback usability testing and heuristic evaluations we developed a platform with a clear value proposition and a viable business model the learnings from each iteration directly informed design refinements and feature prioritization leading to a more user-centered product concept future steps include: further refining the activity creation flow based on ongoing feedback implementing comprehensive onboarding and help features identified as crucial for usability addressing heuristic findings finalizing the mobile prototype development expanding partnerships with small businesses continuously iterating based on user feedback and market trends to ensure lynk remains a valuable tool for fostering connection and combating isolation lynk is poised to become a valuable tool for fostering connection and enhancing well-being in communities",
