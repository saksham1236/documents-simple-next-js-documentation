I conduct thorough user research and testing to enhance user experiences and drive conversion rates. A notable achievement includes contributing to a 193% increase in Research Hub article views and a 93% boost in partner page traffic through strategic content planning and implementation.\n\nAdditionally, as a Scientific Illustrator, I collaborate with researchers to produce illustrations and animations featured on covers and supplementary materials in scientific papers and journals. Notably, I designed a journal cover for Biophysical Journal showcasing the experimental setup and structure of pulmonary surfactants.\n\nHaving completed my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I gained proficiency in coding and web application development, I am now expanding my expertise in data science. I am currently learning Python for data analysis, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. This knowledge empowers me to integrate statistical analysis and predictive modeling into innovative digital solutions.\n\n***\n\n## 🎨 What I Do\n\n* **UX & UI Design** – Intuitive and accessible digital products.\n* **Motion Design** – Animation that clarifies and captivates.\n* **Scientific Illustration** – Visual storytelling for research and science.\n* **Front-End Development** – Building fast, responsive web experiences with modern tools.\n\n***\n\n## 💼 Experience\n\n### Associate Designer\n\n**CDW Canada** · Full-time\r\n📅 Jan 2022 - Present\n\nDesigns static and animated digital/web banners for desktop and mobile.\\\nDevelops and maintains CDW.ca landing pages and emails aligned with brand standards.\\\nTranslates strategic goals into cohesive, responsive digital designs using industry tools.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* Achieved a **193% YoY increase** in Research Hub article views\n* Boosted partner page traffic by **93%** through strategic content planning\n\n### Scientific Illustrator\n\n**Freelance**\r\n📅 Sep 2020 - Present\n\n* Designed the cover for the prestigious Biophysical journal.\n* Produced drawings and illustrations to enhance scientific papers and presentations.\n* Conducted comprehensive research on scientific papers, gaining a deep understanding of theories and core concepts behind experiments and results.\n\n***\n\n## 🧠 My Philosophy\n\n> “Design is empathy in action.

    "content": "## ✨ Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.\n\nAs the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.\n\n## 🔍 Research and Analysis\n\nThe logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.\n\n### Logo Mark Ideas\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas-2.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n### Direction #1 - Playful Gradients, minimalist while being engaging.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-1.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-1.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #2 - Pure minimalist, simple with flat colors.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-2.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-2.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #3 - Mix of both styles.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-3.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n## 🎨 Final Style Guide\n\nThe team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the \"B\" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/final-style-guide.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n## 💻 Website Design Mockup\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/website-mock.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Desktop Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-desktop.png\" altText=\"Desktop Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mobile Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-mobile.png\" altText=\"Mobile Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n## 📱 Some Social Media Assets\n\n### Instagram Post Carousel\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/insta-carousel.png\" altText=\"Instagram Carousel\" />\n\n### Addition of Patterns\n\nTo honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity.

We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.\n\n## 📝 Our Goal\n\n**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.\n\n## 🎯 Our Focusing Themes\n\n<Tag>🤝 Connection</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧠 Mental Wellness</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📍 Local Activities</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🌱 Community Building</Tag>\n\n## ❓ The Core Problem\n\n## 🧠 My Roles\n\n<Tag>🔍 UX Research</Tag>\r\n<Tag>✨ Visual Design</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧪 Usability Testing</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📱 Prototyping</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📊 Business Analysis</Tag>\n\n## 📝 Our Solution\n\nLynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity. It is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local, wellness-oriented activities.\n\nThe app focuses on fostering safe, low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users’ emotional needs. By encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities, the platform supports users in rebuilding routines, forming new relationships, and staying mentally and physically active.\n\n## 🔍 Initial Research and Insights\n\nWe started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they're socially isolated, especially during big life changes like moving for school or work. As young adults ourselves, we brought our first-hand experiences to the table, which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported, connected, and motivated to get involved in our communities again.\n\n### Target Audience\n\nBased on our initial research, we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health, with the following criteria:\n\n#### Target Audience Mood Board\n\nWe asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board. It reflects their experiences and captures the essence of their emotional landscape, highlighting their struggles and aspirations.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-1.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-2.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-3.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n#### Summarized Insights\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\nDuring our initial research, we also conducted market research to better understand our target audience and their needs. We performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market. This helped us recognize the importance of emotional design and user-centered care in creating a supportive and encouraging platform.\n\n#### Competitors\n\n* **Meetup**: Focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations.\n\n* **Citysocializer and Nextdoor**: Offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events, while Nextdoor is known for fostering a safe, friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence. However, these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness.\n\n* **Eventbrite**: A popular event management platform that allows users to create, advertise, and sell tickets for events. It provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience. Eventbrite's focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness.\n\n* **Wine For The People and Clozette**: Wine For The People offers wine tastings and events in an open, approachable setting, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Clozette, on the other hand, builds niche communities through lifestyle branding. Neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness.\n\nWhile these platforms help with connections in different ways, they don't fully meet the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of our target audience. This showed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long isolation.\n\n## 🔄 The Design Process\n\nOur design process was iterative and user-centered, focusing on creating a platform that effectively addresses the needs of young adults experiencing social isolation. We began with a low-fidelity mockup to establish the foundational concept and layout of the application. Through user testing and feedback, we identified key areas for improvement, such as the need for a more minimalistic design and better emphasis on safety measures.\n\nIn the subsequent iterations, we developed high-fidelity prototypes, incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience and establish branding elements. Each iteration built upon the previous one, with a focus on refining the design and functionality of the platform based on user interactions and testing results. Our goal was to create a seamless and intuitive user experience that promotes mental and physical well-being, ultimately addressing the challenges of social isolation.\n\n### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback\n\nOur goal in iteration one was to create a solid foundation for our business idea, focusing on visual design, business, and user experience. We aimed to establish an understanding of our target audience and their needs, as well as the overall direction of our project.\n\n* **Methods**:\n  * Conducted initial market research to identify the target audience and their needs.\n  * Developed a Business Model Canvas to outline the business strategy and value proposition.\n  * Mapped the User Flow and developed Low-Fidelity Prototypes for both web and mobile platforms to visualize the initial design concepts.\n  * Conducted Usability Testing and a Survey to gauge the reception of the idea and establish a basic application layout.\n\n#### User Flow\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-1-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow\" />\n\n#### Low Fidelity Prototype\n\n#### Usability Testing\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Users were tasked with two related activities while navigating through the prototype:\n    1. Logging into the app and signing up to attend an activity.\n    2. Creating an activity for others to attend.\n  * Users had the choice of interacting with either a desktop version or a mobile version, depending on their preferred device.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were mostly able to complete the tasks and navigate the mockup with relative ease.\n* Identified friction in completing tasks due to UX-related reasons, such as a lack of indicators for confirmation when joining an event.\n* Some users indicated that there was too much information being presented, making the whole experience overwhelming and distracting.\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **User Feedback**:\n\n    * One user mentioned, \"I'm not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype, but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me. It took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else.\"\n    * The idea received mixed receptions, with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during COVID-19. Another user commented, \"I guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically. I guess I was expecting more attention to the whole COVID limitation part. To me, it just felt like a way to create events as normal.\"\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Design Improvements**:\n\n    * Identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way.\n    * Recognized the need to optimize button size and design, as some users found the buttons too small.\n    * Considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly, including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Iteration 2: Branding & High-Fidelity Development\n\nIn our second iteration, our main focus was to define the identity and characteristics of our user persona while establishing a strong brand through visual design. Additionally, we conducted another round of user testing for our mid-fidelity prototype.\n\n#### User Persona\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note>\n    **Branding and Visual Design**:\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/branding.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" />\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note>\n    **In-progress High Fidelity Mockup**:\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/mockup-iteration-2.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" />\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n#### Improved User Flow for Joining Activities\n\nWe refined the user flow based on feedback from the first iteration, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the app to find and join activities.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-2-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow\" />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/joining-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Joining Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/creating-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Creating Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n#### Usability Testing - 2\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**\n\n  * Users were asked to perform the following tasks:\n    1. Sign up for the app.\n    2. Create an activity for others to join.\n</Note>\n\n#### Findings\n\n* Users provided very positive responses on the visual aspects of the app.\n* However, users still had difficulties finding where to create and sign up for an activity.\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **Learnings from User Feedback**:\n\n    * The amount of information presented was overwhelming for some users, causing hesitation.\n    * Users found the buttons too small and difficult to see.\n    * There was confusion about the relevance of the company name and motto.\n    * Users expected more emphasis on COVID-19 safety measures and limitations.\n    * Clarity in wording is crucial, as some users found certain phrases confusing.\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Improvements to be Made**:\n\n    * Adopt a more minimalistic and user-friendly information presentation.\n    * Optimize button size and design for better visibility and usability.\n    * Modernize the visual layout, including spacing and menu design.\n    * Replace the company name and motto with a logo to save screen space.\n    * Emphasize the importance of user testing and clear communication.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Iteration 3: UX Testing & Interaction Refinement\n\nOur focus in iteration three was to improve the usability of key user flows based on feedback, especially the process of creating an activity. We tested a more complete desktop prototype and used structured feedback to guide design revisions.\n\n* **Methods**:\n  * Conducted one-on-one usability testing with participants using the high-fidelity desktop prototype.\n  * Used Kano Model survey to assess feature expectations and categorize them by priority.\n  * Focused testing on how users navigated and interacted with the \"Create Activity\" flow.\n\n#### Improved Creating Activity Flow\n\nSplit the activity creation flow into multiple pages to make the information easier for users to understand and complete.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-3-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow for Creating Activities\" />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/expanded-creating-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Improved Creating Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n#### Kano Model Survey\n\n#### Usability Testing - 3\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Create an account.\n  * Explore and join an activity.\n  * Create a new activity using the full creation flow.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were confused by the number of steps required to create an activity.\n* The lack of visual cues and guidance during form-filling led to hesitation.\n* Several users struggled with horizontal scrolling, which disrupted the flow.\n* Some UI elements lacked context, resulting in questions like \"What does this button do?\"\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **User Feedback**:\n\n    * “I wasn’t sure if I completed the activity creation process properly. It needs more guidance.”\n    * “There’s a lot going on in the form. Not sure where to start or what’s important.”\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Design Improvements**:\n\n    * Simplified the activity creation flow by reducing input fields and grouping them logically.\n    * Replaced horizontal scrolling with vertical sections for better clarity.\n    * Added contextual indicators (e.g., tooltips, inline hints) to improve comprehension.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Observations from directly observing users\n\nBecause of the low turnout of participants from the survey, we decided to conduct a moderated usability test with another 2 participants on video-call. We observed them as they navigated through the prototype and took notes on their interactions. This provided us with valuable insights into their thought processes and decision-making.\n\n### Final Changes before MVP\n\n#### Updating the Navbar from Vertical to Horizontal\n\nNoting from the final feedback, to improve navigation, we switched the navbar to a horizontal layout with labels visible to give users a clearer understanding of the different sections of the app.\n\n#### Adding breadcrumbs to the activity creation process\n\nAfter receiveing feedback from users, we added breadcrumbs to the activity creation process to help users understand their current step within the activity creation step and added a back button with label to navigate back to previous steps easily.\n\n#### Payment Processor Pop-Up\n\n#### Adding tooltip information for explaining tags\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/tooltip-after.png\" alt=\"Tag Tooltip\" />\n\n## 🏆 Final Prototype\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/lynk-hero-showcase.png\" alt=\"Final Prototype\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/final-prototype.png\" alt=\"Final Prototype\" />\n\n### Final Presentation\n\n[View the full presentation of the project on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tOqagJp08)\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tOqagJp08\" title=\"Lynk Full Presentation\" />\n",

safety and limitations during covid-19 another user commented i guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically i guess i was expecting more attention to the whole covid limitation part to me it just felt like a way to create events as normal design improvements: identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way recognized the need to optimize button size and design as some users found the buttons too small considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design cardgrid iteration 2: branding high-fidelity development in our second iteration our main focus was to define the identity and characteristics of our user persona while establishing a strong brand through visual design additionally we conducted another round of user testing for our mid-fidelity prototype user persona note

sign up for the app create an activity for others to join findings users provided very positive responses on the visual aspects of the app however users still had difficulties finding where to create and sign up for an activity note type info learnings from user feedback: the amount of information presented was overwhelming for some users causing hesitation users found the buttons too small and difficult to see there was confusion about the relevance of the company name and motto users expected more emphasis on covid-19 safety measures and limitations clarity in wording is crucial as some users found certain phrases confusing improvements to be made: adopt a more minimalistic and user-friendly information presentation optimize button size and design for better visibility and usability modernize the visual layout including spacing and menu design replace the company name and motto with a logo to save screen space emphasize the importance of user testing and clear communication cardgrid iteration 3: ux testing interaction refinement our focus in iteration three was to improve the usability of key user flows based on feedback especially the process of creating an activity we tested a more complete desktop prototype and used structured feedback to guide design revisions methods: conducted one-on-one usability testing with participants using the high-fidelity desktop prototype used kano model survey to assess feature expectations and categorize them by priority focused testing on how users navigated and interacted with the create activity flow improved creating activity flow split the activity creation flow into multiple pages to make the information easier for users to understand and complete imageviewer imageurl images lynk iteration-3-user-map png alt

testing - 3 user tasks: create an account explore and join an activity create a new activity using the full creation flow findings: users were confused by the number of steps required to create an activity the lack of visual cues and guidance during form-filling led to hesitation several users struggled with horizontal scrolling which disrupted the flow some ui elements lacked context resulting in questions like what does this button do note type info user feedback: i wasn t sure if i completed the activity creation process properly it needs more guidance there s a lot going on in the form not sure where to start or what s important design improvements: simplified the activity creation flow by reducing input fields and grouping them logically replaced horizontal scrolling with vertical sections for better clarity added contextual indicators e g tooltips inline hints to improve comprehension cardgrid observations from directly observing users because of the low turnout of participants from the survey we decided to conduct a moderated usability test with another 2 participants on video-call we observed them as they navigated through the prototype and took notes on their interactions this provided us with valuable insights into their thought processes and decision-making final changes before mvp updating the navbar from vertical to horizontal noting from the final feedback to improve navigation we switched the navbar to a horizontal layout with labels visible to give users a clearer understanding of the different sections of the app adding breadcrumbs to the activity creation process after receiveing feedback from users we added breadcrumbs to the activity creation process to help users understand their current step within the activity creation step and added a back button with label to navigate back to previous steps easily payment processor pop-up adding tooltip information for explaining tags imageviewer imageurl images lynk tooltip-after png alt
