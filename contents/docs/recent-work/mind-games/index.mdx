## 💡 The Idea

This project came about through participation in the RSA Design Awards. We had to create a product from a selection of briefs.

## 📝 Our Brief:

**Redistributing Health**  
*How might we design systems that provide seamless and cost-effective access to quality health services for underserved communities?*

## 🎯 Our Focusing Themes:
<Tag>👦 Youth</Tag>
<Tag>💻 Technology</Tag>
<Tag>🦠 COVID-19</Tag>
<Tag>🧠 Mental Health</Tag>

## ❓ The Research Question
<Note type="success">
  <span className="text-xl">
    How does COVID-19 impact the mental health of youth and how can technology-based services 
    improve the mental healthcare experience in 2020?

## 📱 About the App

The main idea of the application was to create a service that gave users access to a **library of games focused on mental wellness**.

## 🔍 User Research

Based on our research, it was clear that COVID-19 created significant barriers that hinder people from getting the care they need.  
The **scarcity of mental health resources** made it harder to help these groups of people, resulting in:

- Bottling up emotions  
- Spontaneous outbursts  
- Worsening unhealthy coping mechanisms  

## 📊 Main Trends

- Rise in screen time and gaming practices  
- Video games were found to be stress-relieving  
- Scientific research showed games were effective in managing mental health

We started prototyping for both mobile and big screens. However, based on user surveys showing preference for **personal computers** for gaming, we shifted focus to big screens for the final prototype.
