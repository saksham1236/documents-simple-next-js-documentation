## üí° The Idea

Lynk began as a capstone project focused on addressing the growing issue of **social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health**, particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments. We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.

## üìù Our Goal:

**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.

## üì± About Lynk

Lynk is a **website and mobile application** designed to help users easily discover and join local activities, fostering social interaction and community engagement. It also provides small businesses with a platform to promote their events.

## üîç User Research & Insights

Our research highlighted that young adults (aged 20-28, especially those in new environments) often experience **sadness, anxiety, and restlessness due to isolation**. They value friendships, community, and physical activity with others.

Key challenges identified:
- Difficulty finding opportunities to connect with others.
- Lack of motivation for independent activities.
- Emotional distress from prolonged solitude.

## üîÑ Our Iterative Process

We followed a 3-iteration process, driven by user feedback and analysis.

### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback

- **Goal:** Establish the core concept and gather initial user feedback.
- **Methods:** Initial market research, Business Model Canvas, Low-Fidelity Prototypes (web/mobile), Usability Testing & Survey.
- **Learnings:** Users found initial prototypes overwhelming, lacked confirmation indicators, and highlighted the need to emphasize safety. Initial revenue model showed a long break-even period.

#### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 1 (Activity Creation & Promotion Setup)

Key Usability Issues Identified:
- Misleading page descriptions and varied headings.
- Lack of user input feedback on filled fields.
- System buttons needed more emphasis.
- Users were lost on their step in the activity creation process.
- Unclear terminology ("add requirements," "Promotion Reach").
- Tedious overall activity creation experience.
- Missing event fees on the activity confirmation page.

Recommendations Included:
- Provide more varied page descriptions and consistent heading structures.
- Create versions of pages with content filled in for better feedback.
- Emphasize system buttons.
- Implement visual indicators for the stage of activity creation.
- Relabel unclear terms (e.g., "add requirements" to "pre-requisites").
- Reduce the number of pages or offer a quick creation option.
- Add event fees to the activity confirmation page.

### Iteration 2: Refining UI & Exploring Viability

- **Goal:** Develop high-fidelity prototypes, establish branding, and explore alternative revenue streams.
- **Methods:** User Persona, Impact Map, High-Fidelity Desktop Prototype, Branding (Name, Logo, Style Guide), SWOT/5 P's Analysis, Updated Financials, Usability Testing.
- **Learnings:** Positive feedback on visual design but users struggled with navigation (finding create/join activity). Identified small business promotions as a viable revenue stream. Learned the importance of clear wording.

#### Heuristic Evaluation - Iteration 2 (Community, Business & Analytics Pages)

Key Usability Issues Identified:
- No progress indication after editing activities on the analytics page.
- No implementation of an undo button for edits.
- Difficulty differentiating "Save Changes" and "Edit Promotion" buttons due to similar appearance.
- No recommended communities for users to join.
- Limited variety of settings for user flexibility.
- Absence of an error screen.
- No help pages or documentation available.

Recommendations Included:
- Add a progress indicator (circle or bar) after saving changes on the analytics page.
- Implement a small undo button.
- Change the appearance of one of the buttons ("Save Changes" or "Edit Promotion") for better differentiation.
- Provide recommended communities based on user interests.
- Offer more diverse settings options (e.g., Dark Mode).
- Include a designed error screen.
- Implement help pages and a "Need Help?" or "FAQs" link at the bottom of pages.

### Iteration 3: Enhancing Flows & Data-Driven Decisions

- **Goal:** Refine core user flows (especially activity creation), integrate business features, and use in-depth research for prioritization.
- **Methods:** One-on-One Usability Testing (focus on activity creation), Kano Model Survey, Refined Financials & Break-Even Analysis, PEST Analysis.
- **Learnings:** Activity creation was still seen as tedious. Users had issues with content organization and understanding context. Kano model prioritized features like ratings and feedback.

## ‚ú® The Solution

The final Lynk prototype is a user-centered platform designed for intuitive activity discovery, creation, and community engagement, incorporating learnings from all iterations.

Key features include:
- Easy Browse and searching for nearby activities.
- Streamlined (though iteratively improved) activity creation process.
- Dedicated profiles for communities and businesses.
- Integrated promotional features for businesses.
- A clear visual design and improved navigation.
- Planned features for ratings, feedback, onboarding, and help, directly addressing heuristic findings and Kano model priorities.

## üìä The Results

Our iterative process yielded significant insights and promising quantitative outcomes:

- **User Growth:** Projected growth from **6,000 users (Year 1) to 24,000 users (Year 3)**.
- **Revenue:** Diversified model including:
    - In-app Transactions: **$30,240 (Year 1)**
    - Paid Business Promotions: **$4,320 (Year 1)**
    - Targeted Advertising: **$375 (Year 1)**
    - Total Income (Year 1): **$34,935**
- **Profitability:** Projected to reach **break-even in ~2 years and 9 months**, with a positive net income in Year 3.
- **Feature Prioritization (Kano Model):** Validated the importance of mandatory features like Ratings System, Participating in Promoted Events, and Sharing Feedback.

These results indicate both a strong potential to meet user needs and a viable path to business sustainability.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion & Next Steps

Lynk successfully addresses the challenge of social isolation through an empathetic and iterative design process. By continuously incorporating user feedback, usability testing, and heuristic evaluations, we developed a platform with a clear value proposition and a viable business model. The learnings from each iteration directly informed design refinements and feature prioritization, leading to a more user-centered product concept.

Future steps include:
- Further refining the activity creation flow based on ongoing feedback.
- Implementing comprehensive onboarding and help features identified as crucial for usability (addressing heuristic findings).
- Finalizing the mobile prototype development.
- Expanding partnerships with small businesses.
- Continuously iterating based on user feedback and market trends to ensure Lynk remains a valuable tool for fostering connection and combating isolation.

Lynk is poised to become a valuable tool for fostering connection and enhancing well-being in communities.
