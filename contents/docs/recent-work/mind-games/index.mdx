## The Idea

This project came about through participation in the RSA Design Awards. We had to create a product from a selection of briefs.

## Our Brief:
**Redistributing Health**
*How might we design systems that provide seamless and cost-effective access to quality health services for underserved communities?*

## Our Focusing Themes:
- Youth
- Technology
- COVID-19
- Mental Health

## The Research Question

**How does COVID-19 impact the mental health of youth and how can technology-based services improve the mental healthcare experience in 2020?**

## My Roles

- UX Research
- Wireframing
- Usability Testing
- Prototyping

## About the App

The main idea of the application was to create a service that gave users access to a **library of games focused on mental wellness**.

## User Research

Based on our research, it was clear that COVID-19 created significant barriers that hinder people from getting the care they need.
The **scarcity of mental health resources** made it harder to help these groups of people, resulting in:

- Bottling up emotions
- Spontaneous outbursts
- Worsening unhealthy coping mechanisms

## Main Trends

- Rise in screen time and gaming practices
- Video games were found to be stress-relieving
- Scientific research showed games were effective in managing mental health

## User Personas

## Initial Ideas

We started prototyping for both mobile and big screens. However, based on user surveys showing preference for **personal computers** for gaming, we shifted focus to big screens for the final prototype.
