I conduct thorough user research and testing to enhance user experiences and drive conversion rates. A notable achievement includes contributing to a 193% increase in Research Hub article views and a 93% boost in partner page traffic through strategic content planning and implementation.\n\nAdditionally, as a Scientific Illustrator, I collaborate with researchers to produce illustrations and animations featured on covers and supplementary materials in scientific papers and journals. Notably, I designed a journal cover for Biophysical Journal showcasing the experimental setup and structure of pulmonary surfactants.\n\nHaving completed my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I gained proficiency in coding and web application development, I am now expanding my expertise in data science. I am currently learning Python for data analysis, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. This knowledge empowers me to integrate statistical analysis and predictive modeling into innovative digital solutions.\n\n***\n\n## 🎨 What I Do\n\n* **UX & UI Design** – Intuitive and accessible digital products.\n* **Motion Design** – Animation that clarifies and captivates.\n* **Scientific Illustration** – Visual storytelling for research and science.\n* **Front-End Development** – Building fast, responsive web experiences with modern tools.\n\n***\n\n## 💼 Experience\n\n### 🧩 Associate Designer\n\n**CDW Canada** · Full-time · *Remote*\\\n📅 Jan 2022 - Present\n\nDesigns static and animated digital/web banners for desktop and mobile.\\\nDevelops and maintains CDW.ca landing pages and emails aligned with brand standards.\\\nTranslates strategic goals into cohesive, responsive digital designs using industry tools.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* Achieved a **193% YoY increase** in Research Hub article views\n* Boosted partner page traffic by **93%** through strategic content planning\n\n### Scientific Illustrator\n\n**Freelance** · Remote\\\n📅 Sep 2020 - Present\n\n* Designed the cover for the prestigious Biophysical journal.\n* Produced drawings and illustrations to enhance scientific papers and presentations.\n* Conducted comprehensive research on scientific papers, gaining a deep understanding of theories and core concepts behind experiments and results.\n\n***\n\n## 🧠 My Philosophy\n\n> “Design is empathy in action.

    "content": "## ✨ Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.\n\nAs the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.\n\n## 🔍 Research and Analysis\n\nThe logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.\n\n### Logo Mark Ideas\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas-2.png\" altText=\"Sketches\" />\n\n### Direction #1 - Playful Gradients, minimalist while being engaging.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-1.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-1.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #2 - Pure minimalist, simple with flat colors.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-2.png\" altText=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-2.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #3 - Mix of both styles.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-3.png\" altText=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n## 🎨 Final Style Guide\n\nThe team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the \"B\" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/final-style-guide.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n## 💻 Website Design Mockup\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/website-mock.png\" altText=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Desktop Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-desktop.png\" altText=\"Desktop Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mobile Design</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/web-mobile.png\" altText=\"Mobile Design\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n## 📱 Some Social Media Assets\n\n### Instagram Post Carousel\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/insta-carousel.png\" altText=\"Instagram Carousel\" />\n\n### Addition of Patterns\n\nTo honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity. I carefully melded these cultural elements with geometric shapes, ensuring a harmonious blend that enhances the existing design aesthetic.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mood Board - Cultural Patterns</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/cultural-patterns.png\" altText=\"Cultural Patterns\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mood Board - Geometric Patterns</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/geometric-patterns.png\" altText=\"Geometric Patterns\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/final-patterns.png\" altText=\"Final Patterns\" />\n\n### Retractable Banner\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/retractable-banners.png\" altText=\"Retractable Banner\" />\n\n### Bounce Back Coin Animation\n\nAnimation illustrating the process of earning Bounce Back cryptocurrency upon completion of learning materials, crafted using Blender.\n\n<video autoPlay loop playsInline muted preload=\"auto\">\n  <source src=\"/images/bb-coin-branding/bb-coin-animation.mp4\" />\n</video>\n",
